Overview
--------
This is an Arduino library for communicating with Modbus slaves over RS232/485 (via RTU protocol). **Updated to support Arduino 1.6.**


Features
--------
The following Modbus functions have been implemented:

Discrete Coils/Flags

  * 0x01 - Read Coils
  * 0x02 - Read Discrete Inputs
  * 0x05 - Write Single Coil
  * 0x0F - Write Multiple Coils

Registers

  * 0x03 - Read Holding Registers
  * 0x04 - Read Input Registers
  * 0x06 - Write Single Register
  * 0x10 - Write Multiple Registers
  * 0x16 - Mask Write Register
  * 0x17 - Read Write Multiple Registers


Uploading Sketches
------------------
Arduinos prior to the Mega have one serial port which must be connected to USB (FTDI) for uploading sketches and to the RS232/485 device/network for running sketches. You will need to disconnect pin 0 (RX) while uploading sketches. After a successful upload, you can reconnect pin 0.


Hardware
--------
This library has been tested with an Arduino [Duemilanove](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDuemilanove), PHOENIX CONTACT [nanoLine](https://www.phoenixcontact.com/online/portal/us?1dmy&urile=wcm%3apath%3a/usen/web/main/products/subcategory_pages/standard_logic_modules_p-21-03-03/3329dd38-7c6a-46e1-8260-b9208235d6fe/3329dd38-7c6a-46e1-8260-b9208235d6fe) controller, connected via RS485 using a Maxim [MAX488EPA](http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1111) transceiver.


Installation
------------
* Arduino 17 (or later):

  Determine the location of your sketchbook by selecting _File > Preferences_ from within the Arduino IDE. If you don't already have a _libraries_ folder within your sketchbook, create one and unzip the archive there. See [this](http://arduino.cc/blog/?p=313) for more information.

* Arduino 16 (or earlier):

  Download the zip file, extract and copy the _ModbusMaster_ folder to _ARDUINO\_HOME/hardware/libraries_. If you are upgrading from a previous version, be sure to delete ModbusMaster.o.


Support
-------

Example
-------
The library contains a few sketches that demonstrate use of the ModbusMaster library. You can find these in the [examples](https://github.com/4-20ma/ModbusMaster/tree/master/examples) folder.
