TrinketFakeUsbSerial, by Frank Zhao

A part of Adafruit's Trinket/Gemma USB Arduino Library

See tutorial at http://learn.adafruit.com/trinket-fake-usb-serial

TrinketFakeUsbSerial allows the user to use a serial terminal to communicate with the Trinket directly via USB. This depends on several pieces of host-side software to be installed first (see TrinketFakeUsbSerialHostSW).

Usage is similar to HardwareSerial, except that task() should be called at least once every 10 ms, or call a function that uses task(), such as available(), or send something. Basically, let the computer know that the Trinket is alive at least once every 10 ms.

TrinketFakeUsbSerial uses V-USB (http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/) to implement USB with a bitbang technique. See the folder "usbdrv" for V-USB files.

Adafruit's Trinket and Gemma can do almost anything that V-USB can do, including USB mouse, keyboards, joysticks, gamepads, MIDI devices, and much more (including custom devices that do not fit any existing category).
