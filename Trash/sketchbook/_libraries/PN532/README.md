PN532
==============

Arduino Library for Seeedstudio NFC Shield based on NXP PN532 chip

The new PN532 library uses SPI HW implementation from official arduino SPI.h library
The original PN532 library from seeedstudio uses a dedicated SPI SW implementation in PN532.h library 

The benefit of HW approach is that MISO/MOSI/SCK PINs can be reused between NFC and Ethernet shields. 
Chip Select (SS) PIN must be different for Ethernet and NFC shields.
In fact, there are three different SS PINs: 
- Ethernet chip hardwired to PIN 10 in Ethernet shield
- SD card chip hardwired to PIN 4 in Ethernet shield
- NFC chip hardwired to PIN10 in NFC shield

In order to avoid conflict between PIN10 in both shields when NFC shield is stacked on top of 
Ethernet shield, male PIN 10 of NFC shield must be bent so that it does not
connect into female PIN 10 of Ethernet shield headers

Connection instructions:
------------------------

Stack Ethernet shield on top of Arduino Uno (connect all PINs including ICSP)  
Stack NFC shield on top of Ethernet shield bending male PIN 10 of NFC shield so that it does not connect
into Ethernet shield

Both official Ethernet and Seeedstudio NFC shields use the ICSP PINs for SPI protocol (instead of the 
actual digital PINs). Since the NFC shield ICSP PINS are unconnected,
 they need to be wired to the appropriate digital PINs in the NFC shield.
This is the required wiring:

- Wire digital female PINs in NFC shield:
           NFC_SS  (NFC)  -> 10 (NFC)  SS    
     Make sure that you choose a free digital PIN for NFC_SS (do not use PINs 0,1,4,10,11,12,13)
     In this sample code NFC_SS is defined as digital PIN 3

- Wire female ICSP PINs of NFC shield to the appropriate female PINs of NFC shield:
           SCK  (ICSP NFC)  -> 13 (NFC)
           MISO (ICSP NFC)  -> 12 (NFC)
           MOSI (ICSP NFC)  -> 11 (NFC)

- Finally wire female ICSP Vcc PIN of NFC shield with the 5V power female PIN of NFC shield
           Vcc  (ICSP NFC)  -> 5V (NFC) This is the 5 Volts power PIN (WARNING: it is NOT digital PIN 5 )

SPI configuration parameters of PN532 chip (NFC) are different from the SPI parameters of 
W5100 chip (Ethernet). 
In particular PN532 uses LSBFIRST bit order while W5100 uses MSBFIRST bit order.
Since both chips are reusing the same library and HW, we need to backup/restore the SPI configuration 
everytime that we use NFC functionality from the new PN532 library

Instructions for Arduino Mega 2560 or ADK:
The HW digital PINs for SPI are different in Arduino Mega (MOSI->51; MISO->50; SCK->52)
The library and sample sketch are fully compatible with Arduino Mega. To make it work, 
just change the wiring of 
ICSP header PINs of NFC shield:

  * Wire female ICSP PINs of NFC shield to the appropriate female PINs 
    of Arduino Mega/ADK shield:
           SCK  (ICSP NFC)  -> 52 (Mega)
           MISO (ICSP NFC)  -> 50 (Mega)
           MOSI (ICSP NFC)  -> 51 (Mega)


KNOWN ISSUES
-------------

The new library does not work when three SPI shields are stacked together (e.g. official Ethernet shield, 
Seeedstudio NFC shield and Sparkfun MP3 shield). 
I believe this is due to noise introduced in the system by the wiring. In this case, the official 
Seeedstudio PN532.h library (SW SPI implementation) can still be used with the appropriate wiring but 
then different PINs must be selected for 
NFC_MISO, NFC_MOSI, NFC_SCK (SW library is not compatible with HW library so they must use 
completely dissociated PIN sets)


Example sketch
--------------
This sample code initializes NFC and Ethernet shields and then enters an infinite loop waiting for 
the detection of NFC/RFID tags.
When a tag is detected, its ID is read and then uploaded to Evrythng server in internet using its 
http REST API.
Note that in order to use this service, you must obtain your own credentials from Evrythng 
(check instructions at evrythng.com). 
Alternatively, you can use other similar services available in Internet.

You have to retrieve your authentication token from https:evrythng.net/settings/tokens and update 
its value in your Arduino code: 

    client.println("X-Evrythng-Token: ...yourAPITokenHere...")
    
You must also crate a new thng in evrytng with a property called ReadTag. Once created, you have 
to update its thngId value in your Arduino code: 

    client.println("PUT http:evrythng.net/thngs/...yourThingIdHere.../properties/ReadTag HTTP/1.1");
