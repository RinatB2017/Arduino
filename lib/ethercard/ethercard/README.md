# EtherCard

[![Travis Status][S]][T]

**EtherCard** is a driver for the ENC28J60 chip, compatible with Arduino IDE.
Adapted and extended from code written by Guido Socher and Pascal Stang.

License: GPL2

The documentation for this library is at http://jeelabs.net/pub/docs/ethercard/.

## Library Installation

1. Download the ZIP file from https://github.com/jcw/ethercard/archive/master.zip
2. From the Arduino IDE: Sketch -> Include Library... -> Add .ZIP Library...
3. Restart the Arduino IDE to see the new "EtherCard" library with examples

See the comments in the example sketches for details about how to try them out.

## Physical Installation

### PIN Connections (Using Arduino UNO):

    VCC -   3.3V
    GND -    GND
    SCK - Pin 13
    SO  - Pin 12
    SI  - Pin 11
    CS  - Pin  8 # Selectable with the ether.begin() function

### PIN Connections using an Arduino Mega

    VCC -   3.3V
    GND -    GND
    SCK - Pin 52
    SO  - Pin 50
    SI  - Pin 51
    CS  - Pin 53 # Selectable with the ether.begin() function
    # The default CS pin defaults to 8, so you have to set it on a mega:
    ether.begin(sizeof Ethernet::buffer, mymac, 53)

## Related Work

There are other Arduino libraries for the ENC28J60 that are worth mentioning:

* [UIPEthernet](https://github.com/ntruchsess/arduino_uip) (Drop in replacement for stock Arduino Ethernet library)
* [EtherShield](https://github.com/thiseldo/EtherShield) (no longer maintained, predecessor to Ethercard)
* [ETHER_28J60](https://github.com/muanis/arduino-projects/tree/master/libraries/ETHER_28J60) (no longer maintained, very low footprint and simple)
